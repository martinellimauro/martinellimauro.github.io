I am a sociologist working at the intersection of **health**, **discrimination** and **social inequalities**. <br>
With a strong focus on quantitative and computational methods, my research combines **survey** data, large-scale **secondary data**, and increasingly incorporate **digital trace data** to develop measures that can be difficult to capture with more traditional data sources.

Currently, my research centers on two main areas:

**Discrimination and social inequality**: I exhamine how discriminatory attitudes influences outcomes such as voting behavior and employment opportunities, and how these these attitudes disproportionately affect marginalized groups, such as ethnic and racial minorities. To do this, I leverage online search data at the community level, to benchmark bias-affected survey items across European countries.

**Health decisions and mental health**: I investigate how individuals make health-related decisions, especially addressing the role of cognitive processes in health-protective behaviors such as vaccination. In a new project, I am exploring the prevalence and distribution of mental health disorders across Danish communities using digital trace data.
